# Eternity Fragancias - Mini E-Shop.

This website is a mini e-shop for fragrances. Users can select products to add to their cart and send the order information via WhatsApp. Additionally, users can save their favorite products to a list, which is stored in LocalStorage. The website was built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, and for the backend API, JSON-Server was used.
